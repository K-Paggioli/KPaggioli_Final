            <h1>Reviews are important to us</h1>
            <p>
                People just like you made the decision to buy a Glowforge, then came back to share their experiences so
                you can decide if it's right for you, too. Thatâ€™s why it is our policy never to edit reviews or give
                incentives for positive reviews. All reviews below are verified as being from real Glowforge owners and
                are posted, unedited, just as they were received.
                To see more of what customers are saying and making in real time, go to <a

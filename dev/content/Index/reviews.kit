                        This is not just a laser, but a new employee joining our company, very extraordinary and
                        incredibly easy to use. Set-up was easy and we had the machine running in minutes. Instructions
                        were clear and provided plenty of resources both for running it the first time and to make sure
                        it continues to run well. Thank you Glowforge.

                        I have loved my Glowforge pro and have run it really well for over a year. Service when needed
                        has been timely and very professional. They got back to me several times on this last Sunday
                        when I was having an issue with the machine not printing or cutting. We came up with the need to
                        replace the unit but it was all resolved in one day on a Sunday and have a plan to ship a unit
                        to me to replace it. Its been a great machine to work with. Could not ask for better service
                        than what I have received the few times that there was an issue. (4) Stars

                        I was able to do a little marketing on my behalf to some local business’s and they have kept me
                        busy with their branding the machine has paid for itself in just a few short months the sky is
                        the limit to a degree but I still have a lot to learn the community as a whole has been nothing
                        short of fantastic
